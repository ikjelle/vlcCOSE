# vlcCOSE (COntinue SEries)
vlc extension for easy continuing series (only .mkv files so far) which are in the same folder.
Choose your serie to continue watching instead of remembering the time you paused the video because you had something comming up. 

## Where do I put my file?
See https://www.vlchelp.com/install-vlc-media-player-addon/ where to put the .lua file

Only tested on linux kde neon (ubuntu 18.04)

Still a few bugs and ugly code, but enjoy if someone ever downloads it.
